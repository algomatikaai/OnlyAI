# OnlyAI: NSFW AI Content Marketplace
## Product Requirements Document for Replit Agent

## Overview

OnlyAI is a desktop-first (mobile-responsive) subscription platform for AI-generated NSFW content. It functions as a two-sided marketplace connecting creators and subscribers, with a business model directly inspired by OnlyFans and Fanvue, combined with the familiar UI/UX elements from Instagram.

The core premise: Anyone can become a creator by generating and training AI characters, then monetizing NSFW content through subscriptions, pay-per-view content, and tips. The platform supports the "teaser → premium" flywheel where creators share SFW teasers on external platforms (TikTok, Instagram, Twitter) to drive traffic to their monetized OnlyAI profiles.

## Flywheel Growth Model

The platform will benefit from the "teaser → premium" flywheel effect:
1. Creators generate AI character and SFW content on OnlyAI
2. SFW teasers are shared to external platforms (TikTok, Twitter, Instagram)
3. Curious users follow links to creator profiles on OnlyAI
4. Users subscribe to access premium NSFW content
5. Creator earnings incentivize more content creation
6. More content leads to more teasers, continuing the cycle

## First Implementation Milestone

For the initial version, focus on these core features:
1. AI character templates (no custom training yet)
2. Basic AI content generation with ModelsLab API
3. Core UI components and navigation
4. Content display and organization
5. Simple user accounts with mock authentication
6. Content categorization (SFW/NSFW)

This approach prioritizes the unique value proposition (AI generation) first, allows for rapid testing and iteration, and provides a foundation for adding authentication and monetization features later.
